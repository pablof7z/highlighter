## Overview

Highlighter is a revolutionary iOS application that transforms passive content consumption into active enlightenment. Built on the [Nostr protocol](https://nostr.com), it creates a social layer for intellectual content where users can highlight, curate, and share valuable insights from any source - articles, books, PDFs, videos, and more.

## Vision

Foster a global swarm of knowledge where value flows to those who illuminate the best ideas. Highlighter combines the best aspects of Reddit's intellectual communities, Kindle's highlighting features, and Notion's organizational capabilities - all within a decentralized, censorship-resistant architecture.
