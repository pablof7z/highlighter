        Since Highlighter is not a platform but rather a tool to interact with Nostr,
        your content can be seen way beyond Highlighter in a myriad of different platforms.

        When you publish content in Nostr, you can choose how far you want your content to reach,
        which provides an opportunity to organically grow your audience without doing any additional work.
